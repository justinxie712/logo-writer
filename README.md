# Logo-Writer Coding Puzzle
## By Justin Xie

Here is my submission for the Viv Lab Frontend Coding Puzzle

## How it was built
1. Used ReactJS
2. Comprises of three main components
  * Main App Component
  * CodeMirror React Component (imported from: https://github.com/JedWatson/react-codemirror)
  * HTML Canvas Component

## Coding Process
I found this challenge to be a bit challenging, primarily because I have not worked with code editors technologies before,
including CodeMirror. I haven't had much experience with HTML Canvas as well, and having to learn how to incorporate both of
these components was the bulk of the challenge.

However, I am proud of the submission I made given my lack of experience. There are some things I would have liked to have improved
on had I had more time than just a weekend to complete it.
